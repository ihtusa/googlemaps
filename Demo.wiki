#summary Demo

= Demo =

There is a demo at http://zohomap.appspot.com/

At the moment the application by default uses a demo account, but you can override this by specifying the parameters "zohoUsername", "zohoPassword" and "zohoApiKey" in the query string. 


Ie.:

{{{
http://zohomap.appspot.com/?zohoUsername=<YOURUSERNAME>&zohoPassword=<YOURPASSWORD>&zohoApiKey=<YOURAPIKEY>
}}}

Note that the username and password are used as a cache key, BUT YOU PROBABLY DON'T WANT TO BE SO STUPID THAT YOU SEND YOUR USERNAME AND PASSWORDS IN CLEARTEXT TO THE DEMONSTRATION APP ANYWAY!
